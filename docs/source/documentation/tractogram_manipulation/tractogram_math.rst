Tractogram manipulations: logical operations, resampling, filtering
===================================================================

Scilpy scripts allow users to modify tractograms in various ways based on their needs, such as shown on Figure 2 in our upcoming paper:


The range of possibilities is wide!
-----------------------------------

- Mathematical operations on two tractograms such as union, intersection and difference can be performed through the :ref:`scil_tractogram_math` script.

- Some scripts allow operations on the tractogram as a whole object in the brain, such as flipping it on a chosen axis (:ref:`scil_tractogram_flip`) or creating a map of all voxels touched by a streamline (:ref:`scil_tractogram_compute_density_map`).

- Other scripts allow operations on the tractogram as set of streamlines, such as resampling the number of streamlines (:ref:`scil_tractogram_resample`, :ref:`scil_tractogram_split`), separating streamlines based on various criteria  (:ref:`scil_tractogram_filter_by_roi`, :ref:`scil_tractogram_filter_by_anatomy`, :ref:`scil_tractogram_filter_by_length`, :ref:`scil_tractogram_filter_by_orientation`) or segmenting a tractogram into bundles (see :ref:`page_tractogram_segmentation`).

- Finally, other scripts allow modifying the streamlines themselves, for instance by resampling the number of points on each streamline (:ref:`scil_tractogram_resample_nb_points`, :ref:`scil_tractogram_compress`), or smoothing the streamlinesâ€™ trajectories (:ref:`scil_tractogram_smooth`). See page :ref:`page_streamlines_math` for more information.

Overall, figure 2 in our upcoming paper represents well the range of possibilities.

Examples of tractogram manipulation
-----------------------------------

Preparing data for this tutorial
********************************

Examples of data for this tutorial can be downloaded using instructions here: :ref:`page_getting_started`. Let's use two tractograms available in the tutorial data:

.. code-block:: bash

    tractogram1=$in_folder/sub-01/sub-01__cst_L_part1.trk
    tractogram2=$in_folder/sub-01/sub-01__cst_L_part2.trk

To look at your data in a viewer, you may use the subject's T1 volume:

.. code-block:: bash

    t1=$in_folder/sub-01/sub-01__t1.nii.gz

We used MI-Brain to visualize both tractograms, which each contain one part of the CST:

.. tip::
    You may download the complete bash script to run the whole tutorial in one step `here </_static/bash/tractogram_manipulation/tractogram_math.sh>`_.


A. Logical operations
*********************

**1. Merging two tractograms (using all streamlines from both).**

If a streamline is exactly the same in both tractograms, it will be kept once.

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_count_streamlines $tractogram1
    scil_tractogram_count_streamlines $tractogram2
    scil_tractogram_math union $tractogram1 $tractogram2 union.trk
    scil_tractogram_count_streamlines union.trk

**2. Finding streamlines belonging in two tractograms (intersection)**

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_math intersection $tractogram1 $tractogram2 intersection.trk

**3. Finding streamlines that are in $tractogram1 but not in $tractogram2**

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_math difference $tractogram1 $tractogram2 difference1-2.trk

Below is the result of the intersection operation. The streamlines in red belonged to both tractograms and form the new file intersection.trk.

B. Tractogram resampling
************************

Resampling means changing the number of streamlines in your tractogram.

**1.  Downsampling: keeping only 20 streamlines**: the most basic option for downsampling is to pick a given number of streamlines randomly. Our initial tractogram1 contains 2598 streamlines. Let's pick 200 of them.

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_resample $tractogram1 200 tractogram_downsampled.trk

It is also possible to downsample per Quickbundles cluster. To understand Quickbundles, refer to page :ref:`page_tractogram_segmentation`. Here, the script will divide your tractogram into sub-sections and will pick the appropriate number in each. This will ensure that the selected streamlines are not *too* random and cover more or less the whole tractogram range. (With this option, the final number of streamlines may not be exactly what you asked for, but will be close).

Most of the time, you can use the default value for --qbx_thresholds, particularly if you are working on whole-brain tractograms. Here, our tutorial data tractogram1 is already a small bundle, so we will be more severe and use 3.

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_resample $tractogram1 200 tractogram_downsampled2.trk \
        --downsample_per_cluster -v --qbx_thresholds 3

See the difference between the two calls above:

+------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Random selection                         | Selection per Quickbundle cluster            |
+==========================================+==============================================+
| .. image:: /??                           | .. image:: ?                                 |
|    :width: 35%                           |    :width: 35%                               |
|    :align: center                        |    :align: center                            |
+------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
=======
You may open and compare tractogram_downsampled.trk and tractogram_downsampled2.trk. Here, data is small and in both cases, the downsampling should cover a good portion of the spatial extend of the bundle, even though the first call is random. On whole-brain data, the difference can be more impressive.

**2. Upsampling:**

To add more streamlines to our tractogram, the script uses randomly picked streamlines to create new similar ones by moving a little bit each point. We will also give a --tube_radius option to make sure final streamlines do not deviate too much from original trajectory.

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_resample $tractogram1 4000 tractogram_upsampled.trk \
        --point_wise_std 5 -v --tube_radius 4

Below, we show a zoomed view on the results. In green: the original bundle. In blue: the new streamlines.

**3. Splitting a tractogram**

We will split our tractogram into subsections. This line of code below will create 3 files: ``out_split_part_0.trk, out_split_part_1.trk, out_split_part_2.trk``.

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_split --nb_chunks 3 $tractogram1 out_split_3_part

It is also possible, instead, to split into files of a given number of streamlines. For instance, this will create N files of 100 streamlines:

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_split --chunk_size 100 $tractogram1 out_split_100_part -v

Finally, it is again possible to split per Quickbundles cluster.

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_split --nb_chunk 3 --split_per_cluster \
          $tractogram1 out_split_3QB_part -v --qbx_thresholds 6

C. Tractogram flipping
**********************

To flip a tractogram on an axis (x, y, z; here we chose the x-axis), you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    scil_tractogram_flip $tractogram1 flipped_x.trk x -v
